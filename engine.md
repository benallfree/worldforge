## Getting Started

It's very easy to get started.

```
yarn
yarn dev

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you submit a pull request for major changes, please run `yarn build` to get a final byte count and delta from what it was. You don't have to submit the new build artifacts but please include the final byte count and delta.
